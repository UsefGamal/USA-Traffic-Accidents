## Introduction
Traffic accidents are a significant concern in the United States, leading to injuries, fatalities, and economic losses. This project seeks to leverage data analysis techniques to uncover valuable insights from a comprehensive dataset of traffic accidents across the country. By exploring this data, we aim to identify factors that contribute to accidents, understand the geographical distribution of accidents, and potentially provide recommendations for improving road safety.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis can be found at [insert link to dataset]. It contains detailed information about traffic accidents in the United States, including factors such as location, weather conditions, road type, severity, and more.

This is a countrywide car accident dataset that covers ``49`` states of the USA. The accident data were collected from ```February 2016``` to ```March 2023```, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. 

- These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by various entities,such as:
    
    - US and state departments of transportation
    - law enforcement agencies
    - traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road networks.
      

- The dataset currently contains approximately ```7.7 million accident records```.
